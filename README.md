# Event App
A hobby project to create something similar to FaceBook Events as a standalone app. The app is also an opportunity to practise techniques I have little or no experience of.

## Functions
When finished the app should contain both public and logged-in-only functions such as create, view and invite to events. Users should be able to comment and RSVP to events. Users should also be ablo to find events based on title, location (e.g. using current location), time and organiser. Events will be public or invite only.
