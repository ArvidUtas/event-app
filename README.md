# Event App
A hobby project to create something similar to FaceBook Events as a standalone app. The app is also an opportunity to practise techniques I have little or no experience of.

## Functions
When finished it should contain both public and logged-in-only functions such as create, view and invite to events. Events will be public or invite only. 

## Tech stack
This is a monorepo containing both front and backend
### Backend

- Java
- Spring
- Cors
- MongoDB
- Maven

### Frontend

- TypeScript
- Vite

### IDEs

- IntelliJ
- VS Code
